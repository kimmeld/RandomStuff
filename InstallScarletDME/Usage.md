# ScarletDME Usage Hints

## Terminal Emulator

ScarletDME seems to require Backspace as Ctrl-H.  

In iTerm2, right-click, Edit Session, Keys, Key Mappings, select Delete key sends ^H.

## Documentation

http://downloads.openqm.com/downloads/qm.pdf seems to be a good reference, though obviously for the continued commercial development after the ScarletDME fork.
